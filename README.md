# Battery-cell-design-Bayesian-optimization\\
Codes and data for the paper "dendrite suppression in fast-charging high-energy metal-ion batteries: a Bayesian optimization approach".\\
Some codes were used for multiple experiments after changing the parameter values.\\
The codes in Matlab need MATLAB R2007b or a later version to run properly.\\
The codes in Python need FEniCS and Ax (BoTorch) components available at https://fenicsproject.org/ and https://ax.dev/ respectively.\\
We have built upon the work https://sourceforge.net/projects/python-fenics-examples/ for the codes in FEniCS.\\
