# Battery cell design by Bayesian optimization  
Codes and data for the paper "dendrite suppression in fast-charging high-energy metal-ion batteries: a Bayesian optimization approach".  
Some codes were used for multiple experiments after changing the parameter values.  
The codes in Matlab need MATLAB R2007b or a later version to run properly.  
The codes in Python need FEniCS and Ax (BoTorch) components available at https://fenicsproject.org/ and https://ax.dev/ respectively.  
We have built upon the work https://sourceforge.net/projects/python-fenics-examples/ for the codes in FEniCS.
